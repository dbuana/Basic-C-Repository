# Basic-C-Repository
Just started coding with C#; only for one day, at least. The program is a basic C# program, which includes, a basic user-input, random function and validation statements. 

P.S: If you want to enhance the program, feel free to create a pull-request; and we can discuss how to intorduce more sophistication into the program. 

Enjoy!
